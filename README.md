# µHoubolt
µHoubolt is an Ethanol/N2O liquid rocket sucessfully flown at EuRoC 2022. It is capable of reaching an altitude of 3km with a 1kg payload, with a lift-off mass of only 12kg and a length of 2m.

To enable other student or amateur teams to benefit from our developments, and maybe even base their own rocket design on µHoubolt, all design ressources are available as open source/hardware.

This repository serves as an overview, containing some project ressources and linking to many others.
